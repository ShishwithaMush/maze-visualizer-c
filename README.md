# Maze Visualizer in C
This project implements maze generation and solving using C.

The maze is generated using an iterative backtracking algorithm
and solved using DFS and BFS with animated console visualization.

## Features
- Perfect maze generation
- DFS and BFS solvers
- ANSI colored console visualization

## Execution
Designed to run on online C compilers or terminals(Preferably GDB)
that support ANSI escape sequences.
